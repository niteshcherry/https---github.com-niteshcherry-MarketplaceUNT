      <h1 class="border-bottom">Hello! <br> This is the UNT MarketPlace</h1>
      <p id="projectDescription">
        This website acts as a Marketplace for UNT. People at UNT 
        will be able to buy and sell the commodities of their wish. Users who want to sell the items will be able to
        post
        them on the site, and other users will be able to view the posted commodities and buy them if interested.
        <br>
        This application mainly helps students at UNT. A considerable percentage of
        students
        rely on unknown sellers to buy the commodities, and this application allows students to overcome this
        disadvantage.
        Additionally, numerous students are graduating every year, and new students join UNTâ€™s; this application
        might
        help pass out students to sell the commodities and incoming students to buy them.
