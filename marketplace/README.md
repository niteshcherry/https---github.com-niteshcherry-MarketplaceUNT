## **Introduction**
This website acts as a Marketplace for UNT . People at UNT  will be able to buy and sell the commodities of their wish. Users who want to sell the items will be able to post them on the site, and other users will be able to view the posted commodities and buy them if interested.

This application mainly helps students at UNT. A considerable percentage of students rely on unknown sellers to buy the commodities, and this application allows students to overcome this disadvantage. Additionally, numerous students are graduating every year, and new students join Stevenâ€™s; this application might help pass out students to sell the commodities and incoming students to buy them.
